Cozmo Bugs:

Voice does it twice - timing problem 
If the robot too close to the cube then it doesnt detect it
If the robot in optimal but cube is less than 350 it will tip it
if the facial expression is unknown then don't say it
don't look for the expression if the robot is too close
try and add lifting and the rotation - ask matthias
recursion doesn't work, but the code if rough but working now


ideas: when doing the movement, pass in the distance from the cube as a param
and move accordingly

If the robot is too close to the cube, then move backward / detect if the lift is hitting the cube

maybe make a UI so user can see what is being recognized
